# Harmonic Balance Simulation Series

## Project Overview
This project, as part of EEE 498/591 RF and Wireless Design Radio, delves into Harmonic Balance simulations, an essential technique in RF engineering used to analyze the behavior of non-linear circuits in the frequency domain. The simulations are designed to provide insights into amplifier saturation, non-linear responses, and the generation of intermodulation products.

## Objectives
- **Understand Harmonic Balance**: Learn the fundamental concepts behind harmonic balance and how it is applied to simulate non-linear electrical systems.
- **1-dB Compression Point (P-1dB)**: Determine the output power level at which the amplifier's gain decreases by 1 dB from its low-power gain.
- **Third Order Intercept Point (IIP3)**: Calculate the hypothetical point where the third-order intermodulation products become equal in power to the fundamental tone.
- **Intermodulation Products (IM)**: Analyze the creation and significance of intermodulation products in communication systems.

## Simulation Tasks
### Task 1: Harmonic Balance Fundamentals
- **Setup**: Learn the basic setup for Harmonic Balance simulation.
- **Execution**: Conduct simulations to determine the 1-dB Compression Point and observe how the amplifier enters compression, leading to a non-linear response.
- **Learning Outcome**: Understand how amplifier saturation occurs and its implications on signal integrity.

### Task 2: Advanced Harmonic Balance Analysis
- **Objective**: Further analyze the non-linear behavior of circuits using more complex setups.
- **Setup**: Use two-tone tests to simulate and analyze the Third Order Intercept Point (IIP3) which helps determine the linearity of an amplifier.
- **Execution**: Perform simulations to generate and measure intermodulation products that occur when the amplifier is driven into non-linearity by high power levels.
- **Learning Outcome**: Gain a deep understanding of IIP3, identifying the nonlinear points and calculating the intermodulation distortion.
