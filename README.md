# RF Simulations Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to hosting a series of advanced RF (Radio Frequency) simulation projects developed at Arizona State University. Each project within this repository focuses on different aspects of RF technology, leveraging advanced simulation tools to address specific challenges in RF design and analysis. Below is an overview of each project contained within this repository.

## Projects

### [ADS RF Design and Analysis Series](ADS%20RF%20Design%20and%20Analysis%20Series)
This series comprises detailed RF design and analysis tasks performed using the Advanced Design System (ADS) software. The projects within this series help students and professionals alike to understand the intricacies of RF circuit behavior, simulation techniques, and their applications in real-world scenarios.

### [Harmonic Balance Simulations](Harmonic%20Balance%20Simulations)
Focused on the application of Harmonic Balance within RF engineering, this project explores the transmission and reflection characteristics of RF amplifiers, utilizing Harmonic Balance to gauge amplifier performance and network behavior under various conditions.

### [Wi-Fi5DesignAndSim](Wi-Fi5DesignAndSim)
This project involves the design and implementation of a spatial reuse access point optimized for the Wi-Fi 5 (IEEE 802.11ac) standard. It aims to enhance network efficiency in dense environments such as sports stadiums, focusing on improved data throughput and signal integrity.
