# Spatial Reuse Access Point Design Using Wi-Fi 5 Standard

## Project Overview
**Wi-Fi5DesignAndSim** focuses on the design and implementation of a spatial reuse access point using Wi-Fi 5 (IEEE 802.11ac) technology. This project enhances network performance in high-density areas such as stadiums by optimizing both the theoretical and practical aspects of network design.

## Objectives
- **Explore Wi-Fi 5 Capabilities**: Utilize the Wi-Fi 5 standard to achieve higher data rates and efficient transmission.
- **Theoretical and Practical Simulations**: Execute simulations in MATLAB for system modeling and ADS for RF circuit design to validate the spatial reuse concept.
- **Analysis and Presentation**: Summarize the simulation outcomes and provide detailed analysis through a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation.
